My research ID and publications are on [Orchid](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4417-7903). 
I sometimes review for Building and Environment. 

# Play
I'm well into rock climbing and my local indoor wall is [Dynamic Rock](http://www.dynamicrock.co.uk/)

I like the outdoors generally actually climbing, walking, surfing or just being outside is great.

To help with some back problems and generally improve myself I started Yoga with [Kathryn](https://www.facebook.com/Yoga.with.Kathryn). I've not been in a while but hope to again in the future


I used to be a member of my local [Hackspace](http://swansea.hackspace.org.uk/) and enjoy a bit of tinkering but again not been in a while.

# Religion
I didn't think I had one until my mum recently told me I was a [Pantheist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheism) , thanks mum
