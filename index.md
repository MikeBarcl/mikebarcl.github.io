I think there is an old bebo account some where though that is best left alone.

There are some posts in this [part of this site](/posts) for example words and pictures of holidays etc.

#Play
I'm well into rock climbing and my local indoor wall is [Dynamic Rock](http://www.dynamicrock.co.uk/)

I like the outdoors generally actually climbing, walking, surfing or just being outside is great.

To help with some back problems and generally improve myself I started Yoga with [Kathryn](https://www.facebook.com/Yoga.with.Kathryn). I've not been in a while but hope to again in the future


I used to be a member of my local [Hackspace](http://swansea.hackspace.org.uk/) and enjoy a bit of tinkering but again not been in a while.

#Religion
I didn't think I had one until my mum recently told me I was a [Pantheist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheism) , thanks mum
