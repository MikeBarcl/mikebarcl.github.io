#Work
I have a 0.5FTE lecturing post at [The University of Wales Trinity St David, School of Architecture, Built and Natural Environments](http://www.uwtsd.ac.uk/built-natural-environment/)

I am open to consultancy if it can be organised around my university commitments. For example I have worked for [Quantarc] (http://www.quantarc.co.uk/), in the Facilities management/Surveying/Building Services Engineering type area.


#Research
My research ID and publications are on [Orchid](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4417-7903). 
I review for Building and Environment and have even been awarded the [outstanding reviewer award](http://www.reviewerrecognition.elsevier.com/recognition/index?key=1B4517F5E6377160A002F298890F30D874C69BE883FDE66EA24A772F30FED96E)

#Social Media
Don't get too excited I don't say much

I think there is a old bebo account some where though that is best left alone.

I will make posts to [part of this site](/posts) for example words and pictures of holidays etc.

#Play
I'm well into rock climbing and my local indoor wall is [Dynamic Rock](http://www.dynamicrock.co.uk/)

I like the outdoors generally actually climbing, walking, surfing or just being outside is great.

To help with some back problems and generally improve myself I've started Yoga with [Kathryn](https://www.facebook.com/Yoga.with.Kathryn)


I'm a member of my local [Hackspace](http://swansea.hackspace.org.uk/) and enjoy a bit of tinkering

#Religion
I didn't think I had one until my mum recently told me I was a [Pantheist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheism) , thanks mum
